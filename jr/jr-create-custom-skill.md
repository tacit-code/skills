Comprehensive Analysis: Creating Custom Skills with skill-creator

  Core Architecture

  The skill-creator system uses a three-tier progressive disclosure architecture       
  optimized for token efficiency:

  1. Tier 1: Metadata (~100 words, always loaded)
    - name and description in YAML frontmatter
    - Claude sees ALL skill names/descriptions to decide which to activate
  2. Tier 2: SKILL.md Body (<5k words, loaded when skill triggers)
    - Procedural instructions and workflows
    - Must be imperative/infinitive form ("To do X, use Y" not "You should do X")      
  3. Tier 3: Bundled Resources (loaded on-demand or executed without context)
    - scripts/ - Executable code (Python/Bash/JS) for deterministic operations
    - references/ - Documentation loaded into context as needed
    - assets/ - Output materials (templates, fonts, images) NEVER loaded into
  context

  6-Step Creation Workflow

  Step 1: Understanding with Concrete Examples

  Goal: Ground skill design in real use cases
  Actions:
  - Gather 3-5 specific examples: "Remove red-eye from image" not "image editing"      
  - Ask users for realistic requests they'd make
  - Validate examples before proceeding

  Step 2: Planning Reusable Contents

  For each example, identify:
  - What code gets rewritten repeatedly? → scripts/
  - What documentation is needed? → references/
  - What templates/files are needed? → assets/
  - What structural pattern fits? (Workflow, Task-Based, Reference, Capabilities)      

  Step 3: Initialize Skill (Automated Scaffolding)

  cd skill-creator/scripts
  python init_skill.py my-skill-name --path /path/to/skills/

  Creates:
  - Complete directory structure with SKILL.md
  - Example files in scripts/, references/, assets/
  - Template with 4 structural patterns and TODO guidance
  - Enforces hyphen-case naming convention

  Step 4: Edit the Skill

  SKILL.md frontmatter - Description is critical:
  ---
  name: my-skill-name
  description: Complete explanation of what the skill does and when to use it.
  Include specific scenarios, file types, or tasks that trigger it. Use
  third-person: "This skill should be used when..."
  ---

  Description Quality Patterns (from real skills):
  - ✅ brand-guidelines: Lists WHAT it does + multiple WHEN triggers + related
  concepts
  - ✅ webapp-testing: Specifies capabilities + tools by name
  - ✅ internal-comms: Explicit activation instruction + exhaustive use case list      

  SKILL.md Body - Answer three questions:
  1. What is the purpose? (1-2 sentences)
  2. When should it be used? (activation criteria)
  3. How should Claude use it? (reference all bundled resources)

  Delete example files not needed for your specific skill.

  Step 5: Package & Validate

  cd skill-creator/scripts
  python package_skill.py /path/to/my-skill-name

  Automatically validates:
  - YAML frontmatter format
  - Required fields (name, description)
  - Naming conventions (hyphen-case, no consecutive hyphens)
  - Creates my-skill-name.zip only if validation passes

  Step 6: Iterate (Real-World Testing)

  1. Use skill on actual tasks (not hypothetical)
  2. Observe Claude's behavior and struggles
  3. Update SKILL.md or resources based on empirical evidence
  4. Re-package and test again

  4 Structural Patterns

  1. Workflow-Based (webapp-testing, docx)
  - Best for: Sequential processes with decision points
  - Structure: Overview → Decision Tree → Step 1 → Step 2...
  - Use when: Clear step-by-step procedures needed

  2. Task-Based (internal-comms, pdf)
  - Best for: Tool collections with different operations
  - Structure: Overview → Quick Start → Task Category 1 → Task Category 2...
  - Use when: Multiple independent capabilities

  3. Reference/Guidelines (brand-guidelines)
  - Best for: Standards or specifications
  - Structure: Overview → Guidelines → Specifications → Usage
  - Use when: Stable, finite information frequently referenced

  4. Capabilities-Based (mcp-builder)
  - Best for: Integrated systems with interrelated features
  - Structure: Overview → Core Capabilities → Feature 1 → Feature 2...
  - Use when: Multiple features that work together

  Advanced Patterns & Best Practices

  ✅ DO:
  - Keep SKILL.md under 5k words
  - Include keywords section for discoverability
  - Use decision trees for complex workflows
  - Tell Claude to use scripts as "black boxes" (--help first)
  - Provide concrete examples with realistic user requests
  - Use third-person in descriptions
  - Include explicit "When to use this skill" sections

  ❌ DON'T:
  - Duplicate information between SKILL.md and references/
  - Create generic skills overlapping Claude's base capabilities
  - Write in second person
  - Include TODOs in distributed skills
  - Assume Claude will infer when to use the skill
  - Read large script files into context unnecessarily

  Token Economics Strategy

  Scripts (scripts/):
  - Can execute WITHOUT loading into context (critical efficiency)
  - Still readable for patching/debugging
  - Example: with_server.py manages complex server lifecycle as black box

  References (references/):
  - Loaded ONLY when Claude determines it's needed
  - Include grep search patterns if >10k words
  - Anti-pattern: Duplicating SKILL.md content

  Assets (assets/):
  - NEVER loaded into context (zero token cost)
  - Pure output materials: templates, fonts, boilerplate

  Practical Quick-Start Commands

  # Navigate to skill-creator
  cd /mnt/d/git-org/tacit-code/skills/skill-creator/scripts

  # Create new skill
  python init_skill.py data-analyzer --path ../../

  # Validate without packaging
  python quick_validate.py ../../data-analyzer

  # Package for distribution
  python package_skill.py ../../data-analyzer ./dist

  Key Success Criteria

  A skill succeeds when:
  1. Activation: Claude loads it at the right times (description quality)
  2. Execution: Claude follows workflows correctly (instruction clarity)
  3. Efficiency: Token usage is minimal (resource organization)
  4. Reliability: Consistent, correct results (deterministic via scripts where
  needed)

  The skill-creator is production-ready with full tooling support. The
  document-skills (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf) are real production examples
  demonstrating advanced patterns.
